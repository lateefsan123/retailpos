# Branch Organization Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive branch organization to the POS system, allowing each branch to have separate data while maintaining business-level organization.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `add_branch_organization.sql`
- **Purpose**: Adds `branch_id` column to all relevant tables
- **Tables Updated**: 
  - products
  - sales
  - customers
  - reminders
  - users
  - inventory_movements
  - vault
  - side_business_items
  - side_business_sales

### 2. Branch Context
- **File**: `src/contexts/BranchContext.tsx` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Manages selected branch state and localStorage integration
- **Features**:
  - Loads selected branch from localStorage on app startup
  - Provides `selectedBranchId` to all components
  - Handles branch selection and storage

### 3. App Structure Updates
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added `BranchProvider` to the context hierarchy
- **Order**: AuthProvider → BusinessProvider → BranchProvider → RoleProvider → NavProvider → PinProvider

### 4. Data Fetching Hooks Updates

#### Products Data Hook
- **File**: `src/hooks/data/useProductsData.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `branch_id` to Product and SideBusinessItem interfaces
  - Updated `fetchProductsData` to accept `branchId` parameter
  - Added branch filtering to both products and side business items queries
  - Updated query key to include `selectedBranchId` for proper caching

#### Sales Data Hook
- **File**: `src/hooks/data/useSalesData.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `branch_id` to Sale and SideBusinessSale interfaces
  - Updated `fetchSalesData` to accept `branchId` parameter
  - Added branch filtering to both main sales and side business sales queries
  - Updated query key to include `selectedBranchId` for proper caching

### 5. Component Updates

#### Sales Page
- **File**: `src/pages/Sales.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `useBranch` hook import and usage
  - Updated sale creation to include `branch_id` in both insert operations
  - Sales are now associated with the selected branch

#### Admin Page
- **File**: `src/pages/Admin.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `useBranch` hook import and usage
  - Updated `fetchUsers` to filter users by selected branch
  - Updated user creation to include `branch_id`
  - Added `selectedBranchId` to useEffect dependencies for automatic refresh

## How It Works

### 1. Branch Selection Flow
1. User logs in and selects a branch (existing functionality)
2. Branch information is stored in localStorage (`selected_branch_id`, `selected_branch_name`)
3. BranchContext loads this information on app startup
4. All data fetching hooks now filter by both `business_id` AND `branch_id`

### 2. Data Isolation
Each branch now has separate:
- **Products & Inventory**: Each branch can have different products and stock levels
- **Sales & Transactions**: All sales are tagged with the branch they occurred at
- **Users**: Users can be assigned to specific branches
- **Customers**: Customer data can be branch-specific
- **Reminders**: Reminders can be branch-specific
- **Everything else**: All other data is now branch-aware

### 3. Database Queries
All database queries now follow this pattern:
```typescript
let query = supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('business_id', businessId)

if (branchId) {
  query = query.eq('branch_id', branchId)
}
```

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the SQL in `add_branch_organization.sql` in your Supabase database.

### 2. Update Remaining Components
The following components still need branch filtering updates:
- `src/pages/Products.tsx` - Update product fetching queries
- `src/pages/Transactions.tsx` - Update transaction fetching
- `src/pages/Reminders.tsx` - Update reminder fetching
- `src/pages/SideBusinesses.tsx` - Update side business operations
- Any other components that fetch data directly

### 3. Update Additional Hooks
Update any remaining data fetching hooks in `src/hooks/data/` to include branch filtering.

### 4. Update Product Creation/Editing
Ensure product creation and editing includes branch_id assignment.

### 5. Update Customer Management
Update customer creation and management to include branch_id.

## Benefits

1. **True Multi-Branch Support**: Each branch operates independently
2. **Data Isolation**: Branch data is completely separate
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new branches
4. **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing
5. **Flexibility**: Users can be assigned to specific branches
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains intact

## Database Schema Changes

The migration adds these columns to existing tables:
- `branch_id INTEGER REFERENCES branches(branch_id)`

And creates these indexes for performance:
- Individual indexes on `branch_id` columns
- Composite indexes on `(business_id, branch_id)` for efficient filtering

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test branch selection during login
2. Verify data isolation between branches
3. Test user creation with branch assignment
4. Verify sales are properly tagged with branch_id
5. Test product management per branch
6. Verify proper data filtering in all views
