# 🔐 PIN System Implementation Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Problem
- PINs were never created when adding users
- PIN authentication code existed but was unused
- Users kept getting redirected to owner account

### Solution
Added complete PIN functionality to user creation and editing system.

---

## 📋 Features Added

### 1. **PIN Field in Add User Form** (`Admin.tsx`)
- Optional 4-6 digit PIN field
- Real-time validation (numbers only)
- Helpful tooltip explaining PIN purpose
- Secure bcrypt hashing before database storage

### 2. **PIN Field in Edit User Form** (`Admin.tsx`)
- Update existing user PINs
- Leave blank to keep current PIN
- Same validation and security as creation

### 3. **Automatic PIN Detection** (`SelectUser.tsx`)
- Checks for both `pin` (legacy) and `pin_hash` (secure)
- Automatically shows PIN prompt when user has PIN set
- Works across all SelectUser components

### 4. **Secure PIN Storage**
- PINs are hashed with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- Both `pin_hash` (secure) and `pin` (legacy compatibility) stored
- Automatic migration from plaintext to hashed

## 🎯 How to Use

### **Creating a User with PIN:**

1. Navigate to **Admin** page
2. Click **Add User**
3. Fill in:
   - Username: `cashier1`
   - Password: `password123`
   - **PIN: `1234`** ← Optional but recommended!
   - Role: Cashier
   - Branch: Select branch
   - Icon: Choose icon
4. Click **Add User**

### **Using PIN for Quick Login:**

1. Go to **SelectUser** page (user switching)
2. If you have a PIN set, you'll see a PIN prompt
3. Enter your PIN (e.g., `1234`)
4. You're in! Much faster than typing full password

### **Editing/Adding PIN to Existing User:**

1. Go to **Admin** page
2. Click **Edit** on a user
3. Enter new PIN in the PIN field (or leave blank to keep current)
4. Click **Update User**

## 🔒 Security Features

### **PIN Hashing**
```typescript
// Before storing in database
const pinHash = hashPassword(pin) // Uses bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
userData.pin_hash = pinHash
userData.pin = pin // Keep for legacy compatibility
```

### **PIN Verification**
```typescript
// When user enters PIN
if (user?.pin_hash) {
  // Secure: Use bcrypt verification
  isValid = await bcrypt.compare(enteredPin, user.pin_hash)
} else if (user?.pin) {
  // Legacy: Plaintext comparison for backward compatibility
  isValid = user.pin === enteredPin
}
```

### **Validation**
- **Length**: 4-6 digits only
- **Characters**: Numbers only (no letters/symbols)
- **Optional**: PINs are not required, passwords still work
- **Update Protection**: Can't see current PIN (security)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Test 1: Create User with PIN**
- [ ] Go to Admin page
- [ ] Add new user with PIN `1234`
- [ ] Check database: `pin` and `pin_hash` columns should be populated
- [ ] Verify `pin_hash` is bcrypt hash (starts with `$2a$` or `$2b$`)

### **Test 2: PIN Login**
- [ ] Logout and go to SelectUser page
- [ ] PIN prompt should appear automatically
- [ ] Enter PIN `1234`
- [ ] Should switch to user successfully

### **Test 3: Password/PIN Toggle**
- [ ] Go to SelectUser page
- [ ] Skip PIN prompt (click X or back)
- [ ] Select a user
- [ ] Toggle between "Password" and "PIN" tabs
- [ ] Try logging in with both

### **Test 4: Edit User PIN**
- [ ] Go to Admin page
- [ ] Edit existing user
- [ ] Change PIN to `5678`
- [ ] Try logging in with new PIN
- [ ] Old PIN should no longer work

### **Test 5: Create User WITHOUT PIN**
- [ ] Go to Admin page
- [ ] Add new user, leave PIN blank
- [ ] User should be created successfully
- [ ] No PIN prompt should appear for this user

## 💡 Usage Tips

### **When to Use PINs:**
- ✅ Quick user switching during shifts
- ✅ Tablet/POS environments where typing is slow
- ✅ Cashiers who switch frequently
- ✅ Less sensitive roles (not for owners/admins)

### **When to Use Passwords:**
- ✅ Initial login
- ✅ Owner/Admin accounts
- ✅ Sensitive operations
- ✅ Remote access

### **Best Practices:**
- 📌 Use 6-digit PINs for better security
- 📌 Don't reuse the same PIN across users
- 📌 Change PINs regularly
- 📌 Disable inactive users instead of sharing PINs
- 📌 Use strong passwords even if you have a PIN

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: PIN Prompt Not Showing**
**Solution:** User probably doesn't have a PIN set
- Go to Admin → Edit User → Set PIN → Save
- Try SelectUser page again

### **Problem: "Invalid PIN" Error**
**Solution:** 
1. Check you're entering the correct PIN
2. Try using password instead (toggle to "Password" tab)
3. Have admin reset your PIN

### **Problem: Can't Create User with PIN**
**Solution:** Check PIN format
- Must be 4-6 digits
- Only numbers (no letters/symbols)
- Example: `1234`, `123456`, `4567`

### **Problem: PIN Field Not Visible in Admin**
**Solution:** 
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check you're on the latest version
